# Sandbox
This is a Python scripts related to Juniper Networks's PyEZ.
I don't have anything which is useful here, yet. These script are 
|ostly for testing and playing.

First thing first, you need to install PyEZ. The main thing that  
you need is to get "python" installed on your machine.
Since I am using Mac OSX, this means that python 2.7.3 is pre-installed.
According to Juniper site - http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos-pyez1.2/topics/task/installation/junos-pyez-server-installing.html - I also need XCode.
